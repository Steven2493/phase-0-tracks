# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

Version Control is a amazing way to keep your code from breaking if someone uploads a bad code or if it breaks. The reason why it's important is because you could always roll back to a version of when the code was working correctly and fix what ever problem caused it to crash.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master branch its main use is to add feature that well improve the master branch. The reason you make a branch is that it doesn't ruin the master branch if something were to break.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records any changes you make to the respository. And what makes a good commit message is a small message that tells you what you change so if another person were to check it out they could see what you. So, they have a rough idea on what was changed.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you try to merge a branch you made into the master branch and something goes wrong like when you adde a file name with another file on the master with the same name. Or if the file you were trying to add no longer exist the branch.
